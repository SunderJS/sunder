Sunder is a framework for Service Workers like those found in [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com). It allows you to create testable APIs and websites in a similar way as you would using Node.js's [Koa](https://koajs.com) or [Express](https://expressjs.com) framework.

Sunder is designed to be minimal, testable, and easy to understand. It's only a few hundred lines of code.
